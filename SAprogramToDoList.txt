Check transition animation for moving rectangles and fix it (use rect[i].getTranslationX() or something instead of i*30)

Add:
Scramble button
Drop-down list of algorithms to choose

"niceify":
Rectangles so they'd be positioned nicely (once their animation is fixed)
Code, seperate what's needed into different classes/methods
Buttons/drop-down list once they're added
