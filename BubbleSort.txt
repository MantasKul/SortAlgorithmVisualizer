Average Complexity O(n²)
Worst Complexity O(n²)

A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps 
through the input list element by element, 
comparing the current element with the one after it, 
swapping their values if needed.

Blue are the Rectangles that are being compared
Green if they are being swapped
Red if they aren't being swapped
