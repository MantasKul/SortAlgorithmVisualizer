# SortAlgorithmVisualizer
Visualizing various Sorting Algorithms. Written in Java, using JavaFX for UI.

## Functionallity
There are different size rectangles that you can shuffle. The visualizer will move those rectangle according to the chosen algorithm while also coloring the rectangles that are currently being compared/moved.

You can start/continue and pause the algorithm visualization as well as choose the desired algorithm to visualize. At any moment (if the animation is not playing) you can shuffle the rectangles. On the side there's short text about the algorithim on how it works.

## Algorithms
There are three algorithms implemented:
- Quick Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
